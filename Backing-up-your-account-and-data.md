The **Accounts** and **Application Data** stores all your public transaction records, private transaction records and OTA balance. Remember, it's important to back up your **Account** & **Application** data regularly and store it offline (recommended) in a safe & secure place.

Ensure that you are on the Mainnet Blockchain (Develop > Network > main network)

## Backup Keystore Accounts

A **keystore** is a repository where private keys are typically stored in a file. Keystore controls your account details, if you lose your keystore files you are at high risks to lose all your current assets, therefore we strongly recommend you backup all keystore files at a place you could trust and won't forget (ie Offline PC device or U-Disk etc).

Under any circumstances, you should NOT share or reveal your keystore information with anyone you don't trust, you might get stolen by doing so . If you think your keystore has been leak to any 3rd parties, please transfer your assets to a new account.

Step 1: Navigate to Files > Backup > Accounts after launching the Wanchain Desktop Wallet

Step 2: Once Accounts menu option is selected, a folder will open with keystore sub-folder

Step 3: The **keystore** sub-folder will have the keystore files of all the accounts held on your Wanchain Desktop Wallet. For instance, the below Wanchain Desktop Wallet has two wallets, hence the keystore folder displays keystore files for two accounts.

**Points to note:**
