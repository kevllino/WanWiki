# Welcome to Wanchain

---
Wanchain's vision is to rebuild finance, by bringing the world's digital assets onto one blockchain. Wanchain's blockchain brings together the unique capabilities of privacy, cross-chain and smart contracts.

Privacy is built into the Wanchain protocol through the integration of ring signatures, one-time stealth addresses, stamp system and private token. To support Cross-Chain capabilities, Wanchain leverages latest research in cryptographic theories to create a non-proprietary protocol based on Secure Multi-Party Compute (SMPC), that makes it easy for any public, private or consortium chains to connect into Wanchain and thus exchange digital assets amongst them. Further, Wanchain's blockchain is based on Ethereum, enabling the ability to deploy any smart contract leveraging the existing development tools. These three aspects of Wanchain make it a compelling platform to deliver any distributed application that requires easy access to assets residing across different blockchains, while still ensuring privacy protection of the asset holders.

**1. Pre-requisite**

If you have previously not participated in the Wanchain Alpha or Beta programs, ignore this section and proceed to the next step.

Otherwise, please uninstall all previous versions of the Wanchain Wallet.

<br> 

**2. Download the Wanchain Wallet**

To store, accept and send WAN, you need the Wanchain wallet. Download the [latest release of the Wanchain wallet](https://github.com/wanchain/go-wanchain/releases/tag/v1.0.0). Choose the release specific to the system you are using.

The app may take up to 5 minutes to launch the first time. Once downloaded, you will now be able to create your account.

<br>

**4. Create your WAN Account**

You will have to first create an account. Make sure that the "main network" is selected.

<br>
<br>

Give the Account a name and create a strong password. Make sure that you remember the password and backup your keystore in a safe place. **If you lose either the keystore or the password, you will permanently lose your WANs**.

<br>

**5. Your Account Address**

You will see 2 addresses against your account.

The first is the 'Public Address' and the second is the 'Private Address'. The 'Private Address' is used for private transactions.

<br>

In this example, the addresses are:
<br>
Public: **0x1212B500Ff0c33Ec08f832431b61E0aAAbdEbC71** 
<br>
Private: **0x0383dec780c958f607044f1b5cd7d8d2775e7c7e4d4f1ab11be9a3570e8484ff5c027c457bf98dc13d101338b7cd0a112552f0702e18199818e78fe3d6e1d6cf420c**.

<br>
<br>

**6. Receiving and Sending WAN**

To receive WANs, copy the 'Public Address' (or the 'Private Address' for Private transactions), and share this address with the other party.

<br>

To send WANs, click on the "Transfer" button, then enter the address of the other party.
