**Notes:**

With 2.0 release, Wanwallet now supports cross-chain transactions with Ethereum. 

Previous versions of Wanwallet still work as usual after release of Wanwallet 2.0, but new features like cross-chain transactions require Wanwallet 2.0 or later.

For users of previous versions, we strongly recommend **backing up keystore files** in a safe location before upgrading to Wanwallet 2.0 to prevent any kind of data loss, though the upgrading process will not alter existing keystore files in any way.

This instruction guide is for Wanwallet 2.0 GUI in which users can send ETH to Wanchain and withdraw ETH from Wanchain to Ethereum.

Users can choose between ETH/WAN main network and test network.

This version combines ETH light wallet and WAN full node wallet.

**Terminology**

**WETH**: Wanchain Ethereum Crosschain Token, ETH symbol on Wanchain.

**HTLC**: Hashed Timelock Contracts.
