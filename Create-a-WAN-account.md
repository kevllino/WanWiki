Step 2: Click on the ACCOUNT button on the top right of the Wallet. Enter the Account name and create a strong Password. Click the OK button to create the account. 
Make sure that you store a copy of your password in a secure place as your WANs will be permanently lost if you forget it. We can not reset the password for you. 

Step 3: The account is create with two addresses: Public address and a Private address. All transactions with the Public address are visible on the blockchain. The Private address can be used for private transactions where both the identity of the sender and receiver are hidden. 
The Account balance in WANs is shown under the Private address. 

The Public and Private address are for illustrative purposes only. Do NOT use them for any transactions as your WANs will be lost forever.
