## I contributed at token sale but don't see my ERC20 tokens on my wallet/etherscan, what should I do?

If you contributed at token sale in October you would have received your temporary tokens. They may not show up on Etherscan however if you add the below details as custom token on your wallet/MEW they will show up. 

Token Contract Address: 0x5Fc6DE61258e63706543bb57619b99cC0E5a5A1F

## Can I move my tokens to another address for security?

As long as you control the new wallet and it's for security, you may move your tokens to another address. You will then need to move it back to the original address for token swap or complete KYC again on the new address. Further details coming soon.

## Can I buy from EtherDelta?

Regardless of participating at token sale or not, EtherDelta tokens will not be exchangeable for WAN coins. More info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P54-MJWTvSE

## Token Swap Delay

There is swap delay right now due to the Chinese spring festival, these should be sent after 26th Feb. 
Double check if:
A) Input token does not match actual swap amount.
B) Tokens sent to another address (not the tokenswap address).
C) Users thinking they are category 1 but are category 2
D) Sending more tokens than bought at the tokensale.

If you login to swap site you will see your swap history at the bottom of the page. If it shows up you should be fine (in the sense the erc20 transfer was recorded)
