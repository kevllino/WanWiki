>Ordinary address vs Private address ? What's the difference? 

For first timer users, you can simple image your address is your bank account number in real life, it's almost same logic that you need balance before you conduct any transactions, hence, your address if here for you to receive and send WANs.

In a nutshell, ordinary address as known as public address which allows everyone see transaction details.
On the opposite, private address as known as MSA (Master Stealth Address) which details will not be revealed 


----------

# Always Back Up

**Remember , it's important to back up your Account & Application data in a safe & secure place**

> Keystore controls your account details, if you lose your keystore files you are at high risks to lose all your current assets, therefore we **strongly recommend** you backup all keystore files at a place you could trust and won't forget (ie Offline PC device or U-Disk etc) . 

At any circumstances, you should **NOT** share or reveal your keystore information with anyone you don't trust, you might get stolen by doing so . If you think your keystore has been leak to any 3rd parties, please transfer your assets to a new account ! 


### We now show you HOW-TO-DO it step by step (Accounts) ：
You can always find your accounts & application data at backups.
>Click File -> Backup -> Accounts /Application data 

![Markdown](https://github.com/wanchain/Wikiphoto/blob/master/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8722.png)

Once you clicked Accounts it will pop up a folder with "Keystore" file inside .

Here is the root for Windows OS:
>C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\wanchain\keystore

Here is the root for Mac OS:
>～/Library/Wanchain/keystore

Double click Keystore file , you will find all your accounts information 

Here are the files you **NEED TO KEEP IN SAFE** all the time !!!  Backup them now in an offlined PC or U-disk.

### Here is HOW-TO-DO-IT for Application data

Almost same process as above, go to File-> Backup -> Application Data 

By clicking the Application data, you will see bunch of files in the folder that pops up to you as below：

![Markdown](https://github.com/wanchain/Wikiphoto/blob/master/%E5%9B%BE%E7%89%8724.png)

**Select them all and copy paste to a safety place where you can trust.**


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Accounts & Application Data** stores all your public transaction records, private transaction records and OTA balance. If you delete these files , you will not lose your assets but you will not be able to see your assets at your current wallet  at meantime unless you back them up in advance . However, you can always call it back via "Import Account" which we have demonstrated to you in above content. 

**Lastly, PLEASE BACK YOUR KEYSTORE & APPLICATION DATA UP NOW AND ALWAYS !!!**
